# AugmentedRealityApp

> This is an AR project done in Blender (for model) and Unity that uses Vuforia (for AR) to display an Augmented Reality card. When the image for recognition is scanned, the model creted in Blender appeares as a 3D model.

> This project is presenting Saint Maryâ€™s Basilica in Krakow, Poland.

Also, the project includes 3 points of interests that were added with Unity. 

1. A lamp that starts a video about the Basilica
2. A cross that shows the information about tickets for visiting the Basilica
3. A trumpet that starts a famous sound of the Basilica

Next to that, application when started on a phone has an INFO button and X button for more information and exiting the app on the top.
